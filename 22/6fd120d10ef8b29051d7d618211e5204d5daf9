Wouter, if you have some time, please try to rebase this PR so we can merge it. Thanks a lot!

Rebased. The test seem to be broken in main though.

Also, I'm not sure on what the policies for this project are, but this PR is not in line with the Flex recipes for the phpunit configuration. I was thinking we first have to fix Flex before we could merge this?

The lines https://github.com/symfony/demo/blob/main/phpstan.dist.neon#L8-L10 can be removed.

This should fix the Lint / PHPStan test
