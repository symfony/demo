There are some failing tests only for PHP 5.5. I don't understand why because we use Symfony's polyfill for mb_strtolower():

```
There were 2 failures:
1) Tests\AppBundle\Utils\SluggerTest::testSlugify with data set #6 ('lorem ру́сский язы... ipsum', 'lorem-ру́сский-язы...-ipsum')
Failed asserting that two strings are equal.

2) Tests\AppBundle\Utils\SluggerTest::testSlugify with data set #7 ('lorem العَرَبِيَّ�... ipsum', 'lorem-العَرَبِيَّ�...-ipsum')

@javiereguiluz, Could we use the slugs without changing their cases?

@javiereguiluz, I think it doesn't work because you use unsupported symbols like `у́` (it's not Cyrillic). See https://github.com/symfony/polyfill-mbstring/blob/master/Resources/unidata/lowerCase.php

@voronkovich I took that from the Wikipedia 😱  Is it wrong?

@javiereguiluz, it's not wrong but those symbols are used rarely.  Try to use: `русский язык`.
