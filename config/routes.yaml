# yaml-language-server: $schema=../vendor/symfony/routing/Loader/schema/routing.schema.json

# This file is the entry point to configure the routes of your app.
# Methods with the #[Route] attribute are automatically imported.
# See also https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html

# To list all registered routes, run the following command:
#   php bin/console debug:router

# These lines define a route using YAML configuration. The controller used by
# the route (FrameworkBundle:Template:template) is a convenient shortcut when
# the template can be rendered without executing any logic in your own controller.
# See https://symfony.com/doc/current/templates.html#rendering-a-template-directly-from-a-route
