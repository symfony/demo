No, the button does nothing that's why I opted to remove the button and make the calendar icon the same as the tags icon

The flatpickr calendar opens when the input field gets focus or is clicked.

I think the intent was that the button would also trigger the picker (see the `aria-label` for instance), but the implementation was broken.
I think it would make sense to update `assets/js/flatpicker.js` to also use the button as trigger.

Hmm, I see.  It may take some time until I get to that.
