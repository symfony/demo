## AddUserCommandTest.php Documentation

**1. Overview:**

This PHP file contains unit tests for the `AddUserCommand` class within a Symfony application. The tests verify that the command correctly creates new user accounts in the database, handling both interactive and non-interactive input scenarios. 

**2. Package/Module Name:** App\Tests\Command

**3. Class/File Name:** AddUserCommandTest.php

**4. Detailed Documentation:**


* **Class: `AddUserCommandTest`**
    * This class extends `AbstractCommandTestCase`, indicating it's a test case for a Symfony command. It utilizes PHPUnit to execute and validate the behavior of the `AddUserCommand`.

* **Method: `setUp()`**
    * Description: Initializes the test environment. Skips tests on Windows systems due to dependency on the `stty` command.
    * Parameters: None
    * Return Values: None
    * Important Logic: Checks the operating system and skips tests if running on Windows.

* **Method: `testCreateUserNonInteractive(bool $isAdmin)`**
    * Description: Tests creating a user non-interactively by providing all required arguments in the command input. 
    * Parameters:
        * `$isAdmin`: Boolean indicating whether the created user should be an admin.
    * Return Values: None
    * Important Logic:
        * Sets up input data based on `$isAdmin`.
        * Executes the `AddUserCommand` with the provided input.
        * Asserts that a user was successfully created and has the correct roles (`ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_USER`).

* **Method: `testCreateUserInteractive(bool $isAdmin)`**
    * Description: Tests creating a user interactively, where the command prompts for missing arguments.
    * Parameters:
        * `$isAdmin`: Boolean indicating whether the created user should be an admin.
    * Return Values: None
    * Important Logic:
        * Executes the `AddUserCommand` with only partial input (e.g., `--admin`).
        * Provides responses to interactive prompts for missing arguments.
        * Asserts that a user was successfully created and has the correct roles (`ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_USER`).

* **Method: `isAdminDataProvider()`**
    * Description: Generates data provider for testing both normal users and admin users.
    * Parameters: None
    * Return Values: Generator yielding arrays containing boolean values (false for normal user, true for admin).
    * Important Logic: Provides two test cases, one for each role type.

* **Method: `assertUserCreated(bool $isAdmin)`**
    * Description: Helper method to assert that a user was created correctly with the expected attributes.
    * Parameters:
        * `$isAdmin`: Boolean indicating whether the created user should be an admin.
    * Return Values: None
    * Important Logic:
        * Retrieves the user from the database using the email address provided in the input data.
        * Asserts that the user exists, has the correct full name, username, and password hash.
        * Verifies that the user's roles match the expected values based on `$isAdmin`.

* **Method: `getCommandFqcn()`**
    * Description: Returns the fully qualified class name of the command being tested.
    * Parameters: None
    * Return Values: String representing the fully qualified class name of `AddUserCommand`.



**5. Pseudo Code:**


```
// Class: AddUserCommandTest

// Method: testCreateUserNonInteractive(bool $isAdmin)
  1. Set input data based on $isAdmin flag.
  2. Execute AddUserCommand with provided input.
  3. Assert that a user was created successfully.
  4. Verify user attributes (full name, username, password hash, roles).

// Method: testCreateUserInteractive(bool $isAdmin)
  1. Set partial input for the command (e.g., `--admin`).
  2. Provide responses to interactive prompts for missing arguments.
  3. Execute AddUserCommand with provided input and responses.
  4. Assert that a user was created successfully.
  5. Verify user attributes (full name, username, password hash, roles).

// Method: assertUserCreated(bool $isAdmin)
  1. Retrieve the user from the database using the email address.
  2. Check if the user exists.
    - If not, throw an exception.
  3. Verify user attributes (full name, username, password hash, roles).
    - Compare with expected values based on $isAdmin flag.



```

**Dependencies and Libraries:**


* **Symfony Component:** The code relies heavily on Symfony's framework components for command execution, database interaction, and testing utilities. 
* **PHPUnit:** Used for writing and executing unit tests.
* **UserPasswordHasherInterface:**  This interface is part of Symfony's security component and is used to securely hash user passwords.
