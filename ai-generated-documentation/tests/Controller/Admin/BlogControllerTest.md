## BlogControllerTest Documentation

**1. Overview:**

This file contains unit tests for the `BlogController` within a Symfony application. The tests focus on functionality related to managing blog posts in the backend admin interface. 

**2. Package/module name:** App\Tests\Controller\Admin

**3. Class/file name:** BlogControllerTest.php

**4. Detailed Documentation:**

* **Class: `BlogControllerTest`**
    - This class contains functional tests for the `BlogController`. It utilizes the Symfony testing framework to simulate user interactions and verify expected responses from the controller. 

* **Method: `setUp()`**
    - Description: Initializes the test environment by creating a new client instance and logging in as an admin user named "jane_admin".
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Values: None
    - Important Logic: Retrieves the `UserRepository` from the container, finds the user with username "jane_admin", and logs them in using the `loginUser()` method of the client.

* **Method: `testAccessDeniedForRegularUsers()`**
    - Description: Tests that regular users are denied access to admin pages for blog posts. 
    - Parameters: `httpMethod` (string), `url` (string) - These parameters define the HTTP method and URL used to access the protected resource.
    - Return Values: None
    - Important Logic: Logs in a regular user ("john_user"), sends an HTTP request using the provided method and URL, and asserts that the response status code is 403 (Forbidden).

* **Method: `getUrlsForRegularUsers()`**
    - Description: Generates URLs for various admin blog post actions that should be inaccessible to regular users.
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Values: A generator yielding pairs of HTTP method and URL.
    - Important Logic: Defines a set of URLs representing common operations on blog posts within the admin interface.

* **Method: `testAdminBackendHomePage()`**
    - Description: Tests that the backend homepage for blog posts displays all available posts successfully.
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Values: None
    - Important Logic: Sends a GET request to the `/en/admin/post/` URL, asserts a successful response status code, and verifies the presence of table rows representing blog posts on the page.

* **Method: `testAdminNewPost()`**
    - Description: Tests the functionality of creating a new blog post through the admin interface.
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Values: None
    - Important Logic: Sends a GET request to `/en/admin/post/new`, fills out the form with random data, submits it, and asserts a successful redirect to the list of posts. It then verifies that the newly created post exists in the database with the expected title, summary, and content.

* **Method: `testAdminNewDuplicatedPost()`**
    - Description: Tests the validation logic for preventing duplicate blog post titles.
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Values: None
    - Important Logic: Attempts to create a new post with an existing title, triggering a validation error. It asserts that the appropriate error message is displayed and the form field for the title is marked as invalid.

* **Method: `testAdminShowPost()`**
    - Description: Tests the functionality of viewing an individual blog post in the admin interface.
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Values: None
    - Important Logic: Sends a GET request to `/en/admin/post/1` and asserts a successful response status code.

* **Method: `testAdminEditPost()`**
    - Description: Tests the functionality of editing an existing blog post in the admin interface.
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Values: None
    - Important Logic: Sends a GET request to `/en/admin/post/1/edit`, updates the title, submits the form, and asserts a successful redirect. It then verifies that the post's title has been updated in the database.

* **Method: `testAdminDeletePost()`**
    - Description: Tests the functionality of deleting a blog post from the admin interface.
    - Parameters: None
    - Return Values: None
    - Important Logic: Sends a GET request to `/en/admin/post/1`, submits the delete form, and asserts a successful redirect. It then verifies that the post is no longer present in the database.

* **Method: `generateRandomString()`**
    - Description: Generates a random string of a specified length.
    - Parameters: `length` (int) - The desired length of the random string.
    - Return Values: A random string of the given length.
    - Important Logic: Uses a predefined set of characters to construct the random string and ensures its length is as requested.
