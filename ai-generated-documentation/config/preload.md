## preload.php Documentation

**1. Overview:**

This PHP script `preload.php` is designed to load pre-compiled container data for a Symfony application in production mode. It checks if a pre-loaded container file exists and includes it if found, optimizing the application startup process.

**2. Package/module name:**  Symfony (framework)

**3. Class/file name:** preload.php

**4. Detailed Documentation:**

* **Function: None explicitly defined.** The script consists of a single conditional statement that executes code based on file existence.


* **Important Logic:**
    - The script checks if the file `App_KernelProdContainer.preload.php` exists within the `/var/cache/prod` directory relative to the script's location. 
    - If the file exists, it is included using `require`. This assumes that the pre-compiled container data is stored in this file and provides a faster startup mechanism compared to recompiling the container on every request.

**5. Pseudo Code:**

```
// File: preload.php

1. Determine the path to the cache directory: 
   - Calculate the path using `dirname(__DIR__)` to go up one level from the current directory and then append `/var/cache/prod`.

2. Construct the full path to the pre-loaded container file:
   - Combine the calculated cache directory path with the filename `App_KernelProdContainer.preload.php`.

3. Check if the pre-loaded container file exists:
   - Use the `file_exists()` function to determine if the constructed file path points to an existing file.

4. If the file exists:
   - Include the pre-loaded container file using `require` to load its contents into the current script's execution context.


5. End of script execution. 
```



**Dependencies and Libraries:**

* **Symfony Framework:** This script is part of a Symfony application, relying on its internal mechanisms for caching and container management.

* **PHP Core:** The script utilizes standard PHP functions like `dirname`, `file_exists`, and `require`.
