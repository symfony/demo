## Pseudo Code


The pseudocode for the CSS stylesheet is not directly applicable as it defines visual presentation rather than algorithmic logic. 

However, we can illustrate how a specific rule might be implemented conceptually:

```
// Example: Styling a button with primary color

1. Target the element with class "btn-primary"
2. Set background-color to "#007bff" (blue)
3. Set border-color to "#007bff" 
4. Set text-color to "#fff" (white)
5. Set padding to 10px 16px (top and bottom, left and right)
6. Set font-size to 16px
7. Set cursor to pointer


```
