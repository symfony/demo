## admin.css Documentation

**1. Overview:**

This CSS file (`admin.css`) defines styles specifically for the administrative backend of a web application. It targets various pages and elements within the backend interface, including post listings, individual post views, and form controls. 

**2. Package/module name:**  N/A (CSS files are not typically organized into packages or modules)

**3. Class/file name:** admin.css

**4. Detailed Documentation:**

* **No functions or methods exist in CSS.** Styles are defined using selectors and declarations.


* **Variables:**
    * `--blue`: A custom variable set to the color #007bff, likely used for primary actions or links within the backend interface.

* **Selectors and Declarations:**

   -  **`body#admin_post_index .item-actions`**: Styles applied to action buttons associated with posts on the "Backend post index" page.
      - `white-space: nowrap`: Prevents line breaks within the action button container, ensuring all buttons are displayed horizontally.
   - **`body#admin_post_index .item-actions a.btn + a.btn`**: Styles applied to consecutive action buttons on the "Backend post index" page.
      - `margin-left: 4px`: Adds a 4-pixel left margin between consecutive buttons for visual spacing.

   - **`body#admin_post_show .post-tags .label-default`**: Styles applied to default tags displayed on the "Backend post show" page.
      - `background-color`, `color`, `font-size`, `margin-right`, `padding`: Define the visual appearance of the tag elements, including background color, text color, font size, spacing, and padding.

   - **`body#admin_post_show .post-tags .label-default i`**: Styles applied to icons within default tags on the "Backend post show" page.
      - `color`: Sets the icon color to a specific shade of gray.

   - **`.form-control`**: Styles applied to form control elements (e.g., input fields, select boxes) throughout the backend interface.
      - `border-width`: Defines the width of the border around form controls.

   - **`.form-control:focus`**: Styles applied to form controls when they are in focus (e.g., selected by the user).
      - `color`, `box-shadow`: Changes the text color and removes the default box shadow when a form control is focused, likely for visual feedback.



**5. Pseudo Code:**

CSS does not have a traditional flow of execution like programming languages. Instead, it defines styles that are applied to HTML elements based on matching selectors. 


The pseudocode would describe how different CSS rules are applied to specific HTML elements when the page is rendered by the browser. However, this is more akin to a visual representation of the styling hierarchy than a step-by-step execution flow.
