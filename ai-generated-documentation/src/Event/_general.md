## General Documentation for Event package

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Event package, outlining its purpose, functionalities, and usage guidelines. The Event package is designed to facilitate event-driven programming within applications built using PHP. It enables developers to define custom events, subscribe listeners to these events, and trigger events when specific actions or conditions occur. This promotes loose coupling between different parts of the application, allowing for more modular and maintainable code.

The package provides a robust framework for handling events, including features such as event dispatching, listener registration, and event propagation. It adheres to established design patterns and best practices, ensuring reliability and extensibility. Developers can leverage the Event package to implement various use cases, such as:

* **Real-time updates:** Notify users or other components about changes in data or application state.
* **Workflow automation:** Trigger a sequence of actions based on specific events.
* **Logging and monitoring:** Record events for auditing purposes or system monitoring.
