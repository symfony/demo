## General Documentation for Form package

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Form package, detailing its functionalities, usage, and underlying concepts. The Form package offers specialized form field types designed to enhance user experience and streamline data input within Symfony applications. It leverages JavaScript plugins like Bootstrap Date\Time Picker and Bootstrap-tagsinput to provide interactive and intuitive interfaces for handling datetime values and tag inputs respectively.

The package includes custom form types such as `ChangePasswordType`, `CommentType`, `PostType`, `UserType`, `DateTimePickerType`, and `TagsInputType`, each tailored to specific data requirements.  `ChangePasswordType` simplifies the process of changing user passwords securely, while `CommentType` facilitates efficient comment submission with validation and formatting. `PostType` streamlines the creation of blog posts with fields for title, content, and tags. `UserType` handles user registration and profile updates with appropriate input fields. `DateTimePickerType` provides a user-friendly interface for selecting date and time information using the Bootstrap Date\Time Picker JavaScript plugin.  `TagsInputType` enables efficient multi-tag selection and input through an interactive tag suggestion and management system.

The Form package is designed to be easily integrated into existing Symfony projects, offering a convenient way to enhance form functionality and improve the overall user experience.
