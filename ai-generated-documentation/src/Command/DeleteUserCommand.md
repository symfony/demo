**4. Detailed Documentation:**


* **Class:** DeleteUserCommand
    * **Description:** This class defines a Symfony console command for deleting users from the database. It interacts with the user to obtain the username, validates the input, retrieves the user record, removes it from the database, and logs the action.

* **Constructor (`__construct`)**
    * **Description:** Initializes the command object by injecting dependencies: `EntityManagerInterface`, `Validator`, `UserRepository`, and `LoggerInterface`.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `EntityManagerInterface`: An interface for interacting with the Doctrine ORM entity manager.
        * `Validator`: A custom validator class responsible for validating user input, including usernames.
        * `UserRepository`: A repository for managing user entities in the database.
        * `LoggerInterface`: An interface for logging events and messages.

* **`configure()`**
    * **Description:** Configures the command by defining its name (`app:delete-user`), description, and arguments. It adds an argument named "username" which is required to specify the username of the user to delete. 
    * **Parameters:** None
    * **Return Values:** None

* **`initialize()`**
    * **Description:** Initializes the SymfonyStyle object for formatting console output. This is optional but provides a consistent look and feel for command outputs.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `InputInterface`: An interface representing the command's input arguments.
        * `OutputInterface`: An interface representing the command's output stream.

* **`interact()`**
    * **Description:** Handles user interaction if the "username" argument is not provided. Prompts the user to enter the username and validates it using the `Validator` class. 
    * **Parameters:**
        * `InputInterface`: An interface representing the command's input arguments.
        * `OutputInterface`: An interface representing the command's output stream.

* **`execute()`**
    * **Description:** Executes the command logic. Retrieves the user record based on the provided username, removes it from the database using the Doctrine ORM, and logs the successful deletion. 
    * **Parameters:**
        * `InputInterface`: An interface representing the command's input arguments.
        * `OutputInterface`: An interface representing the command's output stream.
