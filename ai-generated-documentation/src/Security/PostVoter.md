## PostVoter.php Documentation

**1. Overview:**

This PHP file defines a security voter named `PostVoter` used within the Symfony framework. This voter is responsible for determining whether a user has permission to perform specific actions on blog posts, such as showing, editing, or deleting them. 

**2. Package/module name:** App\Security

**3. Class/file name:** PostVoter.php

**4. Detailed Documentation:**


* **Class: `PostVoter`**
    - This class extends Symfony's `Voter` class and implements authorization logic for blog posts. It defines three specific permissions: `DELETE`, `EDIT`, and `SHOW`.

    * **Method: `supports(string $attribute, mixed $subject)`**
        - **Description:** Checks if the voter supports the given attribute and subject. 
        - **Parameters:**
            - `$attribute`: A string representing the permission being requested (e.g., 'delete', 'edit', 'show').
            - `$subject`: The object on which the permission is being checked (in this case, a `Post` object).
        - **Return Values:** 
            - `true`: If the voter supports the given attribute and subject.
            - `false`: Otherwise.
        - **Important Logic:** This method ensures that the voter only handles permissions related to blog posts (`Post` objects) and the defined attributes (`SHOW`, `EDIT`, `DELETE`).

    * **Method: `voteOnAttribute(string $attribute, $post, TokenInterface $token, ?Vote $vote = null)`**
        - **Description:** Determines whether the user has permission for the given attribute on the provided post object.
        - **Parameters:**
            - `$attribute`: The permission being requested (e.g., 'delete', 'edit', 'show').
            - `$post`: The `Post` object on which the permission is being checked.
            - `$token`: The security token representing the currently authenticated user.
            - `$vote`: An optional `Vote` object that can be used to indicate the voter's decision (e.g., `Vote::ACCESS_GRANTED`, `Vote::ACCESS_DENIED`).
        - **Return Values:** 
            - `true`: If the user has permission for the given attribute on the post.
            - `false`: Otherwise.
        - **Important Logic:** This method retrieves the currently logged-in user from the security token. It then checks if the user is the author of the given post. If they are, the user is granted permission; otherwise, permission is denied.



**5. Pseudo Code:**

```
// Class: PostVoter

// Method: supports(attribute, subject)
  - Check if subject is an instance of Post object.
  - Check if attribute is one of 'SHOW', 'EDIT', or 'DELETE'.
    - If both conditions are true, return true; otherwise, return false.

// Method: voteOnAttribute(attribute, post, token, vote)
  - Get the currently logged-in user from the security token.
  - Check if the user is an instance of User object.
    - If not, return false (user is not authenticated).
  - Compare the logged-in user with the author of the given Post object.
    - If they are the same, return true (permission granted); otherwise, return false (permission denied). 


```



**Dependencies and Libraries:**

* **Symfony Security Component:** This code relies heavily on Symfony's security component for authentication, authorization, and voter functionality.  

* **Doctrine ORM:** While not explicitly shown in this snippet, the use of `Post` and `User` entities suggests that Doctrine ORM is used for database interaction.
