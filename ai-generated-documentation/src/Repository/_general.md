## General Documentation for Repository package

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Repository package, detailing its functionalities and how to utilize it effectively within your Symfony application. The package encompasses repositories for managing various entities like Posts, Tags, and Users, enabling efficient data access and manipulation. 

The `PostRepository` class offers specialized methods for querying and retrieving blog posts, including pagination, searching, and filtering by tags. It leverages Doctrine ORM to interact with the database, providing a streamlined approach to post management. The `TagRepository`, while currently empty, serves as a placeholder for future custom queries related to tag data.  The `UserRepository` provides methods for finding users based on their username or email address, facilitating user authentication and retrieval within your application.

This package is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing you to easily add new repositories for other entities as needed.
