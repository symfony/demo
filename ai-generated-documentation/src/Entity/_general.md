## General Documentation for Entity package

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Entity package, outlining its core functionalities and guiding you through its usage. The Entity package is designed to simplify data modeling and management within your application by providing a robust set of tools for defining entities, relationships, and interactions with your database. 

The package leverages Doctrine ORM, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, to seamlessly bridge the gap between object-oriented programming paradigms and relational databases. This allows you to work with data as objects, abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries and database interactions.
